										<h2>Background</h2>
										<p>HAMS is a health tool to improve early detection of heart disease, stress, and more.</p>
									</header>
									<p>Heart disease is a serious health issue in Canada as the second most common cause of death [1].  
										In 2020, over 67,000 Canadians died from heart disease, 17.5% of the population [1] .  
										These numbers are expected to increase due to an aging population, as well as decreased activity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic [2].
										there is room for improvement in the wearables space, particularly in the analysis of heart health data.  
										Although a large dataset can be acquired from this technology, the potential offered by this dataset has not been fully explored by industry.  
										Opportunities to add useful statistics and meaningful health data interpretation can improve both user experience as well as public health.
									<br>
										 Developed by a team of Biomedical engineering students as a capstone project at the University of Victoria, 
										 the HAMS app uses machine learning and trends analysis algorithms to predict health outcomes using wearables data and a brief user survey.</p>
										In addition, this app was designed as a practical learning exercise, to apply skills learned over our degree.  
										It is our hope that this app can be a useful proof-of-concept for future development and advancement in the field of personalized healthcare.</p>
